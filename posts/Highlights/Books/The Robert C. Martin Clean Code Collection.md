## Highlights
- It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=695))
- I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well. ([Location 723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=723))
- code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=776))
- The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=1272))
- What this experience has taught me, through long trial and error, is that functions should be very small. ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=1276))
- Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=1280))
- This implies that the blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call. Not only does this keep the enclosing ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=1295))
- FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=1306))
- A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00666M59G&location=1406))
