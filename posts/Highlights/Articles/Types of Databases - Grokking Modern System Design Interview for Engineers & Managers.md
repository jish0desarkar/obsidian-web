## Highlights
- Atomicity: A transaction is considered an atomic unit. Therefore, either all the statements within a transaction will successfully execute, or none of them will execute. If a statement fails within a transaction, it should be aborted and rolled back.
  Consistency: At any given time, the database should be in a consistent state, and it should remain in a consistent state after every transaction. For example, if multiple users want to view a record from the database, it should return a similar result each time.
  Isolation: In the case of multiple transactions running concurrently, they shouldnâ€™t be affected by each other. The final state of the database should be the same as the transactions were executed sequentially.
  Durability: The system should guarantee that completed transactions will survive permanently in the database even in system failure events.
